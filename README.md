Javascript Quiz Game 

Worked on with Salma Gonzalez 

Created a Javascript quiz game from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and JS.  

Followed the following acceptance criteria from our coursework. 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
